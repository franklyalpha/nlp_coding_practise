"""
Defining reward model:

start with an abstract class defining all the properties the reward model must include, and
need to write specifics for how language models should interact with it. Remember to handle the
devices properly.

Reward model should perform the following procedure:
After receiving the output of language model, it will use the network model to evaluate
the output, and gives a reward signal. The reward signal will then be used to train the
model. May consider having one method for providing the reward signal, and another
general method for fine-tuning the language model.

one problem is how should the fine tuning being conducted. Realizing in typical RL, a
trajectory needs to be sampled before training could go through (delayed reward).
Is this the same case for language model fine-tuning?
